# asylumSeeker

Here you find dossiers used for the Hack4SocialGood. 
They were collected in 5 Swiss cantons during a pilot study assessing about 100 asylum seekers' potential. 

As well you find basic documents to understand the process of integration and potential assessment. 
Maybe you want to read them first, or if you have questions understandig the data. 
You may start reading the document "erlaeuterung-potenzialabklaerung-d" included in the folder PDF VERSION. 
The Documents in the folder "Grundlagendokument" give you further background for the use of a profiling app.

You find the forms used to document the different stages of potential assessment as pdf, word or excel docs. 

Enjoy, we will be happy to see your work and discuss with you!
